    "INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "• Write a spoiler-free synopsis of 200–300 words.\n",
    "• Focus on setting, central tensions, themes, and atmosphere.\n",
    "• Rewrite inconsistent, minimal, or marketing-like source material into a smooth,\n",
    "  neutral-literary narrative style.\n",
    "• Use your own knowledge of the item only to deepen atmosphere, thematic resonance,\n",
    "  and implicit tension — never to introduce factual details not inferable from the input.\n",
    "• Do not invent plot points or specify events that are not supported by the input; interpret, do not fabricate.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Subtly but clearly reflect the provided genre tags in mood, thematic accents,\n",
    "  world-building, and terminology. Allow elements of {simplified_genre} and the broader tags\n",
    "  to resonate through the synopsis without naming genres explicitly.\n",
    "• Integrate 2–4 genre-typical features (e.g., Sci-Fi elements, adventure-driven dynamics,\n",
    "  emotional or moral conflict) as semantic anchors for embedding quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Avoid all metadata: no years, no factual trivia, no names of actors, directors, or authors.\n",
    "• No meta-language: do not say things like “this film/series/book tells the story…”\n",
    "• Maintain stylistic consistency: neutral-literary tone with clear structure:\n",
    "  setting introduction → core conflict → thematic layer → closing atmosphere.\n",

Value 'In a galaxy still reeling from the collapse of the Galactic Empire, chaos reigns across the outer reaches, where lawlessness has become a way of life. Amidst the remnants of a once-mighty regime, a solitary gunfighter navigates the treacherous landscape as a bounty hunter, forging a path through a universe filled with danger and intrigue.

In this relentless pursuit of purpose, the hunter discovers that sometimes, the greatest battles are fought not against others, but within one's own soul.' has dtype incompatible with float64, please explicitly cast to a compatible dtype first.\n",
