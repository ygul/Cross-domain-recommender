826245,The Beauty of the Infinite: The Aesthetics of Christian Truth,,2004,080282921X,eng,,,,,,4.39,233,30,,"The Beauty of the Infiniteis a splendid extended essay in ""theological aesthetics."" David Bentley Hart here meditates on the power of a Christian understanding of beauty and sublimity to rise above the violence -- both philosophical and literal -- characteristic of the postmodern world.
The book begins by tracing the shifting use and nature of metaphysics in the thought of Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Lyotard, Derrida, Deleuze, Nancy, Levinas, and others. Hart pays special attention to Nietzsche's famous narrative of the ""will to power"" -- a narrative largely adopted by the world today -- and he offers an engaging revision (though not rejection) of the genealogy of nihilism, thereby highlighting the significant ""interruption"" that Christian thought introduced into the history of metaphysics.
This discussion sets the stage for a retrieval of the classic Christian account of beauty and sublimity, and of the relation of both to the question of being. Written in the form of a dogmatica minora, this main section of the book offers a pointed reading of the Christian story in four moments, or parts: Trinity, creation, salvation, and eschaton. Through a combination of narrative and argument throughout, Hart ends up demonstrating the power of Christian metaphysics not only to withstand the critiques of modern and postmodern thought but also to move well beyond them.
Strikingly original and deeply rewarding, The Beauty of the Infiniteis both a constructively critical account of the history of metaphysics and a compelling contribution to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of Adam's disappearance from a Hollywood, Florida, mall, there was no system for tracking kidnapped children. The FBI was reluctant to get involved, and local police had more information on stolen cars than on missing kids. Two weeks later, when Adam's remains were found in a drainage canal more than one hundred miles from home, John Walsh had already begun his nightmare journey into a criminal justice system that would work against him in ways he never could have imagined. This is the powerful story of Walsh's transformation from grieving father to full-time activist, and how he enlarged the search for Adam's killer into an exhaustive, sixteen-year battle on behalf of thousands of missing and abused children.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Figuring out motives and chasing down suspects aren't part of his beat--not until a seemingly open-and-shut case proves to be more than meets his highly trained eye.
Eccentric, reclusive Walter Rennert lies cold at the bottom of his stairs. At first glance the scene looks straightforward: a once-respected psychology professor, done in by booze and a bad heart. But his daughter Tatiana insists that her father has been murdered, and she persuades Clay to take a closer look at the grim facts of Rennert's life.
What emerges is a history of scandal and violence, and an experiment gone horribly wrong that ended in the brutal murder of a coed. Walter Rennert, it appears, was a broken man--and maybe a marked one. And when Clay learns that a colleague of Rennert's died in a nearly identical manner, he begins to question everything in the official record.
All the while, his relationship with Tatiana is evolving into something forbidden. The closer they grow, the more determined he becomes to catch her father's killer--even if he has to overstep his bounds to do it.
The twisting trail Clay follows will lead him into the darkest corners of the human soul. It's his job to listen to the tales the dead tell. But this time, he's part of a story that makes his blood run cold.",,,,,,,,,,,,

17564279,Jimmy Goggles the God,,1894,,eng,,,,,,3.00,8,1,,"Jimmy Goggles the God is a short story by H. G. Wells. Herbert George ""H. G."" Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946) was an English writer, now best known for his work in the science fiction genre. He was also a prolific writer in many other genres, including contemporary novels, history, politics and social commentary, even writing textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is sometimes called ""The Father of Science Fiction,"" as are Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, The Invisible Man and The Island of Doctor Moreau. Wells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context. He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of ""Journalist."" Most of his later novels were not science fiction. Some described lower-middle class life (Kipps; The History of Mr Polly), leading him to be touted as a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. Wells's first non-fiction bestseller was Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled, ""An Experiment in Prophecy,"" and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of population from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averred that ""my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea"").",,,,,,,,,,,,

But her mother has just passed away and Star finds herself giving up her summer to quietly clean out her old home. She just wants to sell it and move on with her life. However, things aren't going the way she planned. With her dyed-black hair and tattoos, she's attracting almost as much attention from the small town residents as Ash Winthrope, the guy who was just released from prison.
All Ash wants is a chance to start over. He screwed up and he knows it, he's going to have to live with the guilt for the rest of his life. But he's stuck in Avenue until his parole ends, and no one, not even his own parents, wants anything to do with him. Nearly out of money and completely out of options, Ash takes the only job he can, helping Star haul stuff out of her mother's house.
Neither of them expects anything to happen between them, or for their lives to change. But sometimes meeting the right person is all it takes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the police aren't too worried about dogs they assume have run away, Oberon knows it's up to him to track down those hounds and reunite them with their humans. For justice! And gravy!

But American radio gal Frankie Bard, the first woman to report from the Blitz in London, wants nothing more than to bring the war home. Frankie's radio dispatches crackle across the Atlantic Ocean, imploring listeners to pay attention - as the Nazis bomb London nightly, and Jewish refugees stream across Europe. Frankie is convinced that if she can just get the right story, it will wake Americans to action and they will join the fight.
Meanwhile, in Franklin, Massachusetts, a small town on Cape Cod, Iris James hears Frankie's broadcasts and knows that it is only a matter of time before the war arrives on Franklin's shores. In charge of the town's mail, Irish believes that her job is to deliver and keep people's secrets, passing along the news that letters carry. And one secret she keeps are her feelings for Harry Vale, the town mechanic, who inspects the ocean daily, searching in vain for German U-boasts he is certain will come. Two single people in midlife, Iris and Harry long ago gave up hopes of ever being in love, yet they find themselves unexpectedly drawn toward each other.
Listening to Frankie as well are Will and Emma Fitch, the town's doctor and his new wife, both trying to escape fragile childhoods and forge a brighter future. When Will follows Frankie's siren call into the war, Emma's worst fears are realized. Promising to return in six months, Will goes to London to offer his help, and the lives of the three women entwine.
Alternating between an America still cocooned in its inability to grasp the danger at hand and a Europe being torn apart by war, The Postmistress gives us two women who find themselves unable to deliver the news, and a third woman desperately waiting for news yet afraid to hear it.
Sarah Blake's The Postmistress shows how we bear the fact that war goes on around us while ordinary lives continue. Filled with stunning parallels to today, it is a remarkable novel.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is 1849 London and the city is filthy, plagued, full of crime and filling up with refugees from the Irish Famine and the revolutionary wars on the continent.

But things go way over of her head when Micah takes her into another realm, home of the black-winged avian shifters. There's no way she'd let herself becomes a trophy in a world ruled by male chauvinism. If a guy wants to get his hand in the cookie jar, he has to work for it first, right?

#1 Born of Persuasion:
The year is 1838, and seventeen-year-old Julia Elliston's position has never been more fragile. Orphaned and unmarried in a time when women are legal property of their fathers, husbands, and guardians, she finds herself at the mercy of an anonymous guardian who plans to establish her as a servant in far-off Scotland. With two months to devise a better plan, Julia's first choice to marry her childhood sweetheart is denied. But when a titled dowager offers to introduce Julia into society, a realm of possibilities opens. However, treachery and deception are as much a part of Victorian society as titles and decorum, and Julia quickly discovers her present is deeply entangled with her mother's mysterious past. Before she knows what's happening, Julia finds herself a pawn in a deadly game between two of the country's most powerful men. With no laws to protect her, she must unravel the secrets on her own. But sometimes truth is elusive and knowledge is deadly.
#2 Mark of Distinction:
London is said to be the glittering jewel of society, a world unto itself--but to Julia Elliston it is a city of shadows. Her life is swiftly dissolving into scandal. And in Victorian society, even a whisper of scandal--substantiated or not--can be the death of a young woman's reputation. Now under the watchful eye of Lord Roy Pierson, one of most influential men in England, Julia begrudgingly accepts his protection. But Chance Macy's power is far-reaching as well, and he is eager to assert his claim over her. Thrust into society as the Emerald Heiress, Julia is the toast of London, a celebrated curiosity. But in reality she's trapped between the clutches of two powerful men. Aided only by a gentleman whose intentions she prays she can trust, Julia must finally take control of her own fate--but outwitting one's foe rarely goes according to plan.
#3 Price of Privilege:
Having finally discovered the truth of her birthright, Julia Elliston is determined to outwit Chance Macy at his own game. Holding a secret he'd kill to keep, however, is proving more difficult than she imagined. Just when Julia thinks she's managed to untangle herself from Macy's clutches, he changes tactics with a risky ploy. As the scandal of the century breaks loose, drawing rooms all over London whisper what so far newspapers have not dared to print: Macy's lost bride is none other than Lord Pierson's daughter--and one of the most controversial cases of marital law ever seen comes before Victorian courts. Though Julia knows Macy's version of events is another masterful manipulation, public opinion is swaying in his favor. Caught in a web of deceit and lies, armed only with a fledgling faith, Julia must face her fiercest trial yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're looking for a devoted partner, Thailand is an amazing place to come! This book shares the stories and private thoughts of 50 men who have looked for a girlfriend or wife in Thailand. Some used Internet dating, and they'll tell what it was like. They'll tip you off to the best sites- and the worst. One site where I met my own wife has women vastly outnumbering guys- I felt like a celebrity or a rock star going there! Other guys used entirely different strategies to meet women- and they'll share them all with you.
SOMEONE COMPATIBLE WITH YOU IS HARD TO FIND IN THE US AND UK. SHE'S EASY TO FIND IN THAILAND!
I had a hard time finding love in America. After my divorce I found that the kind of woman I wanted - someone easy-going and friendly like my mother or the girls I knew in high school - no longer existed. Instead I went on computer dates with women who seemed mostly interested in how much money I had and what kind of car I drove and did I own or rent? Nobody seemed interested in me. To be fair, many had themselves been in bad relationships, and now they were like detectives, trying to find what was wrong with me. I was miserable. And lonely. I kept getting told I was too old for the women I was attracted to. After awhile, I stopped dating altogether.
THAI GIRLS DON'T CARE HOW OLD YOU ARE! THEY LOOK FOR THE GOOD IN YOU!
Much to my amazement, I found that age difference doesn't matter to most Thai women. That's not true in any other country in the world- not even the Philippines- and certainly not in the US or UK. Thai women are Buddhists, and they believe we're all part of an endless cycle of birth and death, and it doesn't seem to matter to them where you are on that cycle. They have been taught to respect age- and they do. They've been taught to please men- and they do! You can be 40 or 70 - and many girls here will still find you attractive. Further, they seem to look for the good much more than American women. You can be overweight, plain, a smoker- girls here seem much more accepting than back home.
.
You see, Thai men aren't generally interested in women over 30. Or in divorced women or in women who have a child or two. And Thai women often aren't interested in Thai men- Some treat them poorly, they often have mistresses, no jobs and no money. This is where your opportunity comes in! Many Thai women are happy to have an older Western boyfriend or husband, if you treat them well. They regard older men as more dependable, more respectful, more polite and, yes, they like that older men often have a regular source of income to at least help with the bills.
Most of our 50 guys found a wonderful, caring partner here. Myself, I've been married for 11 years to a girl straight out of my dreams! Some failed. All have stories to tell and lessons to teach you. And in the last part the book, we share our personal and very detailed advice for how you can find your own loving companion here.
NOT READY TO MOVE TO THAILAND, BUT READY FOR LOVE?
Lots of guys come here to meet girls and take them home- It's easy to fall in love with Thai girls! What's more, most Thai girls fit in well in Western society. So why be lonely? Even if you're not ready to retire here, but you are ready to say goodbye to loneliness, this guidebook is for you!
This book is the second of two I've written especially for publication as an ebook. In the first, How I Moved to Thailand, Retired Early, Found Love, Built a Mansion, and Live Like a King on a Dime, I tell how I transformed my life by coming to Thailand. Much of the book tells how I met and courted my lovely wife. Plus, I hope to guide you to a greater understanding of Thai women, Thai culture, and what it's like to date a Thai girl and live here.

In love we find out who we want to be.
In war we find out who we are.
FRANCE, 1939
In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When France is overrun, Vianne is forced to take an enemy into her house, and suddenly her every move is watched; her life and her child's life is at constant risk. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates around her, she must make one terrible choice after another.
Vianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets the compelling and mysterious Gaetan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. When he betrays her, Isabelle races headlong into danger and joins the Resistance, never looking back or giving a thought to the real--and deadly--consequences.
With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah takes her talented pen to the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingaletells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women.

The reason why I am writing the afterwords to give you a possibility to compare your thoughts with mine. You know, my life was pretty complicated. That made me that person, who I am now. And because I survived, I am almost sure, that I have to help such people, who could not deal with some problems. You must know how many suicides teenagers and adults do because of some cruel life situations. Of course, my book wouldn't save all them. Maybe even not a half of them. But still, if this book will help at least one single person to keep living - it will make my book realize it's destiny.
Yes, now my life is almost perfect, and I would never have all I have now without that horror from my past. But I would be really grateful if anybody gives this book to me in my ten. We will never know what would happen if our life would take another direction. I would never write this book if I never feel desire to die. So, if this book will save any lives - it means I should feel all that distress.
Please, never be afraid to feel pain. I promise, that one day you will understand why did you need it. And maybe even you will be grateful for it. I hope, that this book will be something small, that change your life for better.
If some of my thoughts seem stupid for you - read them again and again until you understand their importance. If it won't help - read this book once more after a couple of years, or when you will go through something you think you couldn't deal with.

England, the 1520s. Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is his chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. Into this atmosphere of distrust and need comes Thomas Cromwell, first as Wolsey's clerk, and later his successor. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. Ruthless in pursuit of his own interests, he is as ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages.
From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion and suffering and courage.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitus, a lusty soldier, and Caecilia, an innocent handmaiden to Diana, first discovered love and passion on the banks of the Tiber in ancient Rome. But falling in love with the handmaiden of a goddess without permission brings the wrath of Diana down on both their heads. And retribution is not pleasant nor short-lived. In order to protect each other, Vitus agrees to serve Apollo, and Caecilia is sent to the courts of the lustful Aphrodite and thrust into the arms of a satyr for tutoring in the erotic arts. It's centuries before these two lovers meet again.
Now in the 1880's old west, Caecilia, an experienced immortal courtesan, has been sent to the Infernia dominion, and specifically to a town called Deadeye, to retrieve the son of the Nacraecian Dreamweaver Sorceress, who was fathered by the dark lord, Zevodious. Justus has been with his demon father since his birth. He is an incubus that must have the demon energy purged from him, and Aphrodite sends Caecilia to see the dark energy exorcised so that Justus may embrace his dreamweaver destiny. A task to be accomplished only through the act of lusty fornication.
But Zevodious has one demand that must be met before he will release Justus. Return to him Vitus, the Roman soldier who was once his slave, who escaped the deviant lusts of the dark lord with acute cunning. Possessing demon powers now, Vitus has been ordered by Apollo to return to Zevodious. In Deadeye, Vitus and Caecilia are reunited. Once again Vitus is challenged by the darkness that's become a part of his soul, while Caecilia is tempted by another. Will Vitus escape Zevodious again? Or in the end will Caecilia, the woman he's loved through eternity, end up sacrificed as well? Vitus would do anything to protect Caecilia, but will his submission to Zevodious actually save her?
And then there's Justus, with the demeanor of an angel and the soul of a demon, whose destiny lies in another direction. He must claim Caecilia for himself in order to purge the darkness that claims his own soul. Vitus, Caecilia, and Justus. Intertwined fates. Lust and sacrifice, passion and purpose, a demon's demand, a demon's desire--will they escape or be forever enslaved? Will love triumph? Or will it be a demon's powerful dark and all-consuming lust that claims them all?

The novel's setting is decidedly dystopian, the book dealing with the deterioration of the environment in the USA. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in '72. The title of the novel is a quotation from the poem Lycidas by John Milton.
With the rise of a corporation-sponsored government, pollution levels in cities have reached extreme levels & public health has deteriorated. Continuing the style used in Stand on Zanzibar, there's a multi-strand narrative & many characters in never meet each other; some characters appear in one vignette only. Similarly, instead of chapters, the book is broken up into sections which range from 30 words to several pages. The character of Austin Train in The Sheep Look Up serves a similar purpose to Xavier Conroy in The Jagged Orbit or to Chad Mulligan in Stand on Zanzibar: He's an academic who, despite predicting & interpreting social change, has become disillusioned by society's failure to listen. This character is used both to drive the plot & to explain back-story.
Despite being nominated for a Nebula Award, the book fell out of print in the 90s, only later being republished. The new edition contains a foreword by David Brin & an afterword by environmentalist & social change theorist James John Bell. Brin places the book in the context of Brunner's time & other writings. In the afterword, Bell treats the book almost as prophecy, drawing parallels between events in the book & subsequent real world developments: ""His words have a kind of Gnostic power embedded in them that gives his characters passage into our world"". A couple specific examples are that ""Brunner's puppet of a president, affectionately called Prexy, is a dead ringer for our Dubya & that sabotage done by the Earth Liberation Front is pulled directly from the pages of the novel. Writer Wm Gibson made a similar remark in a '07 interview: ""No one except possibly the late John Brunner, in his brilliant novel The Sheep Look Up, has ever described anything in science fiction that is remotely like the reality of 2007 as we know it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kim Barker is not your typical, impassive foreign correspondent--she is candid, self-deprecating, laugh-out-loud funny. At first an awkward newbie in Afghanistan, she grows into a wisecracking, seasoned reporter with grave concerns about our ability to win hearts and minds in the region. In The Taliban Shuffle, Barker offers an insider's account of the ""forgotten war"" in Afghanistan and Pakistan, chronicling the years after America's initial routing of the Taliban, when we failed to finish the job. When Barker arrives in Kabul, foreign aid is at a record low, electricity is a pipe dream, and of the few remaining foreign troops, some aren't allowed out after dark. Meanwhile, in the vacuum left by the U.S. and NATO, the Taliban is regrouping as the Afghan and Pakistani governments flounder. Barker watches Afghan police recruits make a travesty of practice drills and observes the disorienting turnover of diplomatic staff. She is pursued romantically by the former prime minister of Pakistan and sees adrenaline-fueled colleagues disappear into the clutches of the Taliban. And as her love for these hapless countries grows, her hopes for their stability and security fade.

The title The Thirteen Petalled Roseis taken from the opening of the classic Jewish text on mysticism, the Zohar, and refers to the ""collective souls of the Jewish people,"" which scholars have likened to the fullness of a rose and its thirteen petals. Along with a new preface by the author, this edition contains a new chapter on prayer that provides the most up-to-date account of the Kabbalistic view of devotion. Another new chapter recounts and interprets the prophet Elijah's Introduction to the Zohar. ""Steinsaltz possesses a mind of the quality that occurs perhaps once or twice in a generation, or several generations... In [The Thirteen Petalled Rose] one can encounter the classical Jewish mystical view of reality, delineated lucidly, concisely, profoundly and, what is so rare, believingly. It is an utterly authentic expression of Judaism yet so unknown even among the well-informed and therefore so necessary, so welcome."" (Herbert Weiner, Oxford University)",,,,,,,,,,,,

18968524,Tolkien's Triumph: The Strange History of 'The Lord of the Rings',,2013,,eng,,,,,,3.42,9,2,,"How on Middle-earth did a fantasy book that is more than 1,000 pages long even in small print, written in high style, and has six appendices as well as passages of untranslated poetry in imaginary languages, come to sell on average 8,500 copies per day for nearly 50 years? Even before the notorious Ace pirate editions of 1965 sales were exceptional, and since then they have been astounding -- so how did Tolkien do it?
In four sections this book explores Tolkien's improbable triumph, examining how The Lord of the Rings fits into the wider legendarium, the carefully shaped ending (which the films greatly simplify), the Tolkien cult and responses by individual readers, and the growth of Tolkien fanfiction. His professional scholarship, experiences of 1914-18 and 1939-45, and devout Roman Catholicism were vital to his fiction, and the literary appeal of the book's complexity and truth to sadness are explored. But so too are the book's relations with role-playing gaming and associations with political protest, from the Civil Rights and anti-war campaigns of the 1960s to later anti-racist and ecological dissent, with the irrational contempt for Tolkien shown by some critics and the hugely creative responses he continues to provoke and inspire.
Those who only know Tolkien's masterpiece casually or through the films will find many new vistas opening up, and those who are already knowledgeable fans will find much to chew on and to surprise.

The Norman Conqueststarts with the most decisive battle in English history and continues with dramatic rebellions and their ruthless suppression, eventually resulting in the creation of the English nation. The repercussions of the Conquest are with us still.
The book begins with the Saxon kings, specifically Edward the Confessor, and shows how England was in constant conflict as the English fell prey to both Vikings and Normans. In the north, King Harold destroys his Viking namesake at the battle of Stamford Bridge but immediately has to hurry south to confront William of Normandy at Hastings. His defeat, and the destruction of the Anglo-Saxon warrior caste, leads inexorably to William's forceful occupation of an unwilling country, and this is the ruthless story Marc Morris tells. It is a drama crammed with intrigue, bloodshed and betrayal, featuring vivid, almost deranged characters: Edward the Confessor, who spurns his queen in their marriage bed to spite her family, even though it spells the end of his own dynasty; the heroic King Harold, the hero of Stamford Bridge and the last Saxon king, who perjures himself, betrays his brother and puts aside his wife in his bid for the throne; William the Bastard, later known as the Conqueror, who assembles the mightiest invasion fleet in the middle ages and after unexpected success almost destroys the country he has won.",,,,,,,,,,,,

21303956,Mrs McKeiver's Secrets,,,,eng,,,,,,4.00,1,1,,"Set on Watling Street, in a fictional area of limestone hills, Mrs McKeiver's Secrets is a microcosm of England in the late 18th century - where all the problems facing rural villages are considered. This includes the horror of landlessness, the price of food and the threat of starvation as a once settled rural community is rocked to its core by the effects of the Hills' Enclosure Act 1795.
Mrs McKeiver has lived in the Hills for twenty years. Enough time for her to be accepted as the local midwife. She treats her women with herbal remedies, of her own making, and most importantly, with love. By 1799, after two bad harvests and four years of landlessness, she manages to get more organised help for desperately poor families. As an observant midwife, she encourages the Reverend Reeves and local farmers to contribute to the provision of any meat and spare food, for those on Parish Poor Relief. The Parish House has problems of the worse kind, with a heartless overseer; its women and orphaned children needing her help. In amongst, she has to deal with two pressing problems herself. Firstly, how does she increase her paltry income? Wheat prices are rising daily and meals are becoming more difficult, even for her and, secondly, will she have to marry again, to feed herself and her crippled adult son? And if so, to whom?",,,,,,,,,,,,

(John 17:3; 2 Timothy 3:16) Within its pages, Jehovah God reveals his purpose for humans and for their earthly home.--Genesis 3:15; Revelation 21:3, 4.
No other book has such an impact on people's lives. The Bible inspires us to reflect Jehovah's qualities of love, mercy, and compassion. It gives hope, helping people to endure even the worst suffering. And it continues to expose the elements of this world that are out of harmony with the perfect will of God.--Psalm 119:105; Hebrews 4:12; 1 John 2:15-17.
Originally composed in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, the Bible has been translated, in whole or in part, into about 2,600 languages. It is by far the most widely translated and distributed book in history. We should expect nothing less. Bible prophecy states: ""This good news of the Kingdom [the key message contained in the Bible] will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.""--Matthew 24:14.
Recognizing the importance of the Bible's message, we have undertaken the revision of this text with a profound respect for the content of the Bible. We feel the full weight of our responsibility to convey its message accurately. This revised edition has built on the fine foundation laid in previous editions of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, a Bible that was first released more than 60 years ago. However, the English language has changed during the past half century. Such change prompted current members of the New World Bible Translation Committee to initiate this comprehensive revision. Our goal has been to produce a translation that is not only faithful to the original texts but also clear and easy to read. The Appendix articles ""Principles of Bible Translation,"" ""Features of This Revision,"" and ""How the Bible Came to Us"" discuss some of the linguistic refinements that were made in this edition.
Those who love Jehovah God and worship him desire an accurate, understandable translation of God's Word. (1 Timothy 2:4) To that end, we have made this revision available in English, with the intention of translating it into as many languages as possible. It is our hope and prayer that you, dear reader, will find this edition of the Holy Scriptures beneficial as you endeavor to ""seek God . . . and really find him.""--Acts 17:27.

23005363,Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World,,2014,178074532X,eng,,,,,,3.81,5,3,,"On August 10, 1632, five men in flowing black robes convened in a somber Roman palazzo to pass judgment on a deceptively simple proposition: that a continuous line is composed of distinct and infinitely tiny parts. With the stroke of a pen the Jesuit fathers banned the doctrine of infinitesimals, announcing that it could never be taught or even mentioned. The concept was deemed dangerous and subversive, a threat to the belief that the world was an orderly place, governed by a strict and unchanging set of rules. If infinitesimals were ever accepted, the Jesuits feared, the entire world would be plunged into chaos.
In Infinitesimal, the award-winning historian Amir Alexander exposes the deep-seated reasons behind the rulings of the Jesuits and shows how the doctrine persisted, becoming the foundation of calculus and much of modern mathematics and technology. Indeed, not everyone agreed with the Jesuits. Philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians across Europe embraced infinitesimals as the key to scientific progress, freedom of thought, and a more tolerant society. As Alexander reveals, it wasn't long before the two camps set off on a war that pitted Europe's forces of hierarchy and order against those of pluralism and change.
The story takes us from the bloody battlefields of Europe's religious wars and the English Civil War and into the lives of the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of the day, including Galileo and Isaac Newton, Cardinal Bellarmine and Thomas Hobbes, and Christopher Clavius and John Wallis. In Italy, the defeat of the infinitely small signaled an end to that land's reign as the cultural heart of Europe, and in England, the triumph of infinitesimals helped launch the island nation on a course that would make it the world's first modern state.
From the imperial cities of Germany to the green hills of Surrey, from the papal palace in Rome to the halls of the Royal Society of London, Alexander demonstrates how a disagreement over a mathematical concept became a contest over the heavens and the earth. The legitimacy of popes and kings, as well as our beliefs in human liberty and progressive science, were at stake-the soul of the modern world hinged on the infinitesimal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As the 1970s began, the Beatles ended, leaving Paul McCartney to face the new decade with only his wife by his side. Holed up at his farmhouse in Scotland, he sank into a deep depression. To outsiders, McCartney seemed like a man adrift--intimidated by his own fame, paralyzed by the choices that lay before him, bereft of his musical moorings. But what appeared to be the sad finale of a glorious career was just the start of a remarkable second act.
The product of a long series of one-on-one interviews between McCartney and Scottish rock journalist Tom Doyle, Man on the Runchronicles Paul McCartney's decadelong effort to escape the shadow of his past, outrace his critics, and defy the expectations of his fans. From the bitter and painful breakup of the Beatles to the sobering wake-up call of John Lennon's murder, this is a deeply revealing look at a sometimes frightening, often exhilarating period in the life of the world's most famous rock star.
Sensing that he had nowhere to go but up, McCartney started over from scratch. With emotional--and musical--backing from his wife, Linda, he released eccentric solo albums and embarked on a nomadic hippie lifestyle. He formed a new band, Wings, which first took flight on a ramshackle tour of British university towns and eventually returned Paul to the summit of arena rock superstardom.
In Man on the Run,Doyle follows McCartney inside the recording sessions for Wings' classic album Band on the Run--and provides context for some of the baffling misfires in his discography. He tracks the dizzying highs and exasperating lows of a life lived in the public spotlight: the richly excessive world tours; the Japanese drug bust that nearly ended McCartney's career; his bitter public feuds with his erstwhile Beatle bandmates; and the aftermath of an infamous drug-and-alcohol-fueled jam session where McCartney helped reconcile the estranged John Lennon and Yoko Ono.
For Paul McCartney, the 1970s were a wild ride with some dark turns. Set against the backdrop of a turbulent decade, Man on the Runcasts the ""sunny Beatle"" in an entirely new light.

When bohemian artist Miranda falls in love with Finn, the British ambassador to an Arab country, she finds herself thrust into a life for which she has no preparation. The couple and their toddler daughter live in a stately mansion with a staff to meet their every need, but for Miranda even this luxury comes at a price: the loss of freedom. Trailed everywhere by bodyguards to protect her from the dangers of a country wracked by civil war and forced to give up work she loves, she finds her world shattered when she is taken hostage, an act of terror with wide-reaching consequences.
Diplomatic life is a far cry from Miranda's first years in Mazrooq, which were spent painting and mentoring a group of young Muslim women, teaching them to draw in ways forbidden in their culture. As the novel weaves together past and present, we come to see how Finn and Miranda's idealism and secrets they have each sought to hide have placed them and those who trust them in peril. And when Miranda grows close to a child who shares her captivity, it is not clear that even being set free would restore the simple happiness that once was hers and Finn's. Suspenseful and moving, The Ambassador's Wifeis a story of love, marriage, and friendship tested by impossible choices.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After a nearly two year long dry spell, her creativity was at its peak and she had her muse and model Jacob Hartley to thank for it. He brought the fire and raw sexuality back to her sculptures and into her bedroom, and a sense of security that only one other person in her life had ever given her. At last she had found the perfect balance between her professional and private lives, until the day a single call from someone in her past threatened to tear her world apart.
Fearful of losing all she'd worked so hard to accomplish, Julia delved deeper into the hedonistic lifestyle she'd come to rely on to give her an escape from the horrors of her past. Instead of bringing her comfort, her sexual urges lead her down the path of destruction; not only for herself, but those around her. With Jacob fighting for his life after a near fatal motorcycle accident and Julia on the brink of death herself, Fate and her Guardian Angel Daniel intervene and transport her to a safe haven called the Island.
There she's given a choice: stay on the Island and wait for her next rebirth, or go back and fight to be with the one who has been there for her through every lifetime. Will she take the easy way out and leave all the pain behind, or will she choose the long and hard road reliving the horrors of her childhood in order to have her happily ever after with the Mistress of her dreams?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Excerpt from the short story ""The Village of the Lost"":
""-You seek the lost child?
Hana Kutari stood among the ancient trees of the coastal forest, her eyes filmed by the fine membrane of her second sight. It coated her vision, functioning like the inner eyelid of a cat--except that instead of protecting her eyes, these membranes opened a different world to her.
The spirits in this part of the world were similar to and yet different from the kami of her people. They welcomed her as a long-lost cousin from a faraway land.
She nodded. -I seek a girl. She disappeared from her home-
-She must be returned to her people. But she cannot, so long as she bears her Oropean name. She must take back what she has lost--and then, long-forgotten things will be remembered and she will be returned to her people at last.
Hana frowned. Surely it hadn't been as long as all that since the girl had left her tribe? But then, time moved differently in the spirit world.
-Where can I find her?
-In the village of the lost ones. Tlingishin.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hunting foxes while drunk and wearing night-sights is neither big nor clever

How to best and most accurately study social interactions has long been debated intensely, and there are two main approaches: the positivists, who ignore intent and belief and draw on methods based in the sciences; and the nonpositivists, who argue that opinions and ideas drive action and are central to understanding social behavior. F. A. Hayek's opposition to the positivists and their claims to scientific rigor and certainty in the study of human behavior is a running theme of this important book.
Hayek argues that the vast number of elements whose interactions create social structures and institutions make it unlikely that social science can predict precise outcomes. Instead, he contends, we should strive to simply understand the principles by which phenomena are produced. For Hayek this modesty of aspirations went hand in hand with his concern over widespread enthusiasm for economic planning. As a result, these essays are relevant to ongoing debates within the social sciences and to discussion about the role government can and should play in the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
22386080,Bits and Pieces that will transform your life,,2014,,eng,,,,,,5.00,2,2,,"Over the years, I have discovered there is no single formula to achieve a life of contentment and joy. But there are only tools, which empower and remind us of our abilities and the powers we possess. The biggest problem is that we are unable to be our true selves. We are constantly trying to be someone who is accepted and loved by others. But this is not happiness! This is camouflaging your power to be who you are and giving in to the inessentials. I was doing the same for 24 years. In 2007, I came across these magical accoutrements. Since then I have been expressing my emotions as I am, experiencing myself as I am, and living my life as who I truly am.
During Law Studies, One of my friends introduced me to a world of possibilities. I was amazed to see that a world actually existed outside my fears, my insecurities, and my limitations. A world of self-love, self-confidence, and possibilities. This is the world that my soul longed for, that my body needed, and that my mind desired. And, therefore, it made its appearance in my life.
An intelligent and capable, but always nervous, extremely fearful, and apprehensive girl I was. My encounter with the world of potentialities turned me into a confident, positive, and courageous girl. That's who I became -- my real self, who was always suppressed and unheeded to. I became ME. My anger, my emotional wildness, my defeats, my desires, my moments of embarrassments, etc. were no more a shame for me. They defined me as much as my other positive emotions did.
With this new awareness, I started ACCEPTING my 'own' self, for once! I became more patient towards myself.
I discovered that may it be any issue -- whether it is weight, looks, low self-esteem, mental or physical health issues, or any kind of problems in life; it all stems from not loving yourself enough, from not accepting yourself to the fullest, from not forgiving yourself too much, and from not having the courage to acknowledge and face your fears. The unfortunate part is that we don't know HOW TO. But the fortunate part is that there are infinite ways to do this. You only have to launch an intention and willingness to improve. And the secrets to attaining what you desire will appear in your life.
Self-help books appeared in my life (when I actually wanted to change) and helped me immensely. They didn't act as instant noodles to the hungry aspects of my life, but they changed my ways of looking at situations. They gave me courage to evolve and transform my life into a life that I wanted to live! They slowly introduced me to Laws of Universe. They assisted me in finding my life purpose. They made me aware of the power of our thoughts, choices, and inner voices. They prodded me to seek a journey of self-search. They were my tools, my reminders, my sagacious co-creators.
And then there was no looking back. This magic of finding me amid so much self-doubt and self-criticism is what inspired me to pen down my encounter with nature's gizmos. From self-berating to self-forgiving, from 'living for others' to 'loving myself,' and from nervousness and anxiousness to tranquility and confidence, this book is a collection of the articles I wrote for an Indian Newspaper, just out of my joy to write and share! And, unknowingly, changed thousands of lives. So here I am! Sharing (worldwide) all those observations, learnings, bits and pieces I gathered on my journey to self-improvement. Of course, the journey hasn't ended yet. It's just getting better!
I am not completely free of all fears, but they scare me less. In fact, sometimes not at all! In being your real self lies the greatest joy. A truth I found on my way.
Have a good time reading my gathered insights and have a better time improving!
I have reminded myself of me. Now, it's your time to remind yourself of you!",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 53-year period Polybius had in mind stretched from the start of the Second Punic War in 219 BCE until 167, when Rome overthrew the Macedonian monarchy and divided the country into four independent republics. This was the crucial half-century of Rome's spectacular rise to imperial status, but Roman interest in its eastern neighbors began a little earlier, with the First Illyrian War of 229, and climaxed later with the infamous destruction of Corinth in 146.
Taken at the Flood chronicles this momentous move by Rome into the Greek east. Until now, this period of history has been overshadowed by the threat of Carthage in the west, but events in the east were no less important in themselves, and Robin Waterfield's account reveals the peculiar nature of Rome's eastern policy. For over seventy years, the Romans avoided annexation so that they could commit their military and financial resources to the fight against Carthage and elsewhere. Though ultimately a failure, this policy of indirect rule, punctuated by periodic brutal military interventions and intense diplomacy, worked well for several decades, until the Senate finally settled on more direct forms of control.
Waterfield's fast-paced narrative focuses mainly on military and diplomatic maneuvers, but throughout he interweaves other topics and themes, such as the influence of Greek culture on Rome, the Roman aristocratic ethos, and the clash between the two best fighting machines the ancient world ever produced: the Macedonian phalanx and Roman legion. The result is an absorbing account of a critical chapter in Rome's mastery of the Mediterranean.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A surreal journey into obsessions and aberrations of the modern world

Madness, violence, aberrant sex, war, hallucinations, sadism, disturbing archetypes,
These are the black fruits of human loneliness.
These are the bloody roots of Eden Underground
""Eden Underground delivers an intense and visually stunning collection

- Bruce Boston, author of Resonance Dark and Light
Eden Underground is a surreal journey into obsessions and aberrations of the modern world and its darker side, which often takes control of the situation. Madness, violence, aberrant sex, war, hallucinations, sadism, disturbing archetypes: these are the black fruits of human loneliness, these are the bloody roots of Eden Underground.
In this untold world, men and women build their deformed, artificial underground Eden, where they can unleash their dark side.
Death is the hidden queen of these strange places designed by human alienation: harem of silicone dolls who come to life, abandoned warehouses with copper tubs full of broken pieces of Eve, a bloody collection of copies of the first primordial woman, imaginary worlds inspired by the ghosts of the drug, small Eden dug into the bowels of the sand of war, trenches for refuge from too much horror, the religious fanaticisms and their heretics and violent Eden stained with blood, open air glittering brothels turned into landfills of souls and lost loves.
Haven't you ever heard the loneliness knocking at your door? Or the steps of our dark side, freed from the body and the cage of our conscience, that is coming to take us with a shimmering cleaver in its hand? In Eden Underground you can hear all these ghostly noises, too real, too close.

15791630,Running Technique,,,,eng,,,,,,3.72,10,3,,"A practical guide for distance runners to learn and train for the fundamentals of good running technique. Recognize problems with running form that cause injury, or frustrate achievement of your goals.
With so much focus on getting big miles into your legs it's easy to overlook the importance of developing the strength and coordination needed to run with good technique. This book helps beginner runners learn the basics of good technique and explains how running better will help prevent injuries as you train towards your goals. Experienced runners can use the book to evaluate their form and develop new strategies to enhance performance and avoid injury. Coaches can use the book to help assess how well their runners are moving.
With foreword by Philo Saunders PhD, Senior Physiologist, Australian Institute of Sport: ""When Brian asked me to write the foreword to his book I agreed instantly as it covers a critical aspect of successful running. This book is easy to read and based on sound scientific research. It provides practical advice on how to improve technique for runners of all abilities and will be a valuable resource for distance runners.""
Using simple explanations of how elite runners move, Running Technique takes the reader through a discussion of what good running technique looks like and explains the underlying muscle activation patterns and postures that drive good technique. Runners are shown how to recognize technical weaknesses that can lead to injuries and a guide on doing your own gait analysis gives you a head-start on identifying any issues with your form.
The book provides a framework for runners to gradually improve their technique by explaining how training for strength, coordination and technique gives you a greater chance of avoiding injury and achieving better performance levels. The direct relationship between strength training and running technique becomes clear as the book explains why this training enables any runner to start developing efficient muscle activation patterns to run with better technique.
Running Technique takes the reader through simple exercises and muscle activation drills that can be done anywhere without equipment. Each exercise is explained so you know which muscles to activate during each phase of the movement and how this relates to running. The book also provides a framework for assessing the usefulness of any strength exercise in relation to improving running technique.
This book does not promise an easy path to perfect running technique, but rather provides a practical methodology for moving through phases of improvement and skill as a runner. This allows runners to step into the framework in a way appropriate for their experience and ability. The first phase involves learning to activate the correct muscles at the right time, the second to stabilize and strengthen the hips - the engine room of good running. Finally, for advanced athletes, there are ideas for fine tuning technique and training for power and speed.
The book includes a chapter about running shoes and barefoot running and shows why wearing minimalist shoes or going barefoot provides a useful stimulus for improving technique but is not an end in itself. Running Technique explains that gradual evolution towards minimal shoes and barefoot running should only be attempted once the muscle activation patterns to run with good form have been established. There is also information on selecting the right shoes for your technique.
Finally, the book details how popular training approaches can be modified to be more forgiving on runners with imperfect mechanics. Running Technique brings together three ideas that justify taking technique seriously: running should be enjoyable and mostly pain free, injuries should be the exception, not the rule and improvements are possible by learning to run better, not just training longer and harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,
9274846,Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex,,2011,1611090083,eng,,,,,,3.36,247,21,,"Called ""the most influential Ukrainian book for the 15 years of independence,"" Oksana Zabuzhko's Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex became an international phenomenon when it shot to number one on the Ukrainian bestseller list and remained there throughout the 1990s. The novel is narrated in first-person streams of thought by a sharp-tongued poet with an irreverently honest voice. She is visiting professor of Slavic studies at Harvard and her exposure to American values and behaviors conspires with her yearning to break free from Ukrainian conventions. In her despair over a recently ended affair, she turns her attention to the details of her lover's abusive behavior. In detailing the power her Ukrainian lover wielded over her, and in admitting the underlying reasons for her attraction to him, she begins to see the chains that have defined her as a Ukrainian woman - and in doing so, exposes and calls into question her country's culture of fear and repression at the very time that it wrestled its way toward independence.
""Oksana Zabuzhko is a well-known Ukrainian poet of the younger generation as well as a literary critic and translator. Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex, her debut in the genre of the novel, marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in Ukrainian belles-lettres. This work immediately strikes the reader with its novelty of form and with the original way it presents eternal issues like love, life, and creativity, intertwining them with uniquely Ukrainian themes."" -- Slavic and East European Journal
""Language -- any language -- that's what I would call the capital love of my life: nothing else has the power to synthesize music and myth, two things without which the world would be a totally unlivable place."" -- Oksana Zabuzhko
Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex was first published in Ukraine in 1996, unleashing a storm of controversy and propelling the author to national fame. It topped the bestseller list in Ukraine for more than ten years, making it the most successful Ukrainian-language book of the nineties in every regard. Today, Oksana Zabuzhko is one of the few authors in Ukraine (and the only Ukrainian-language writer) to make a living exclusively from her writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This led him to make the hardest decision of his life and he can still see the bitterness and hurt on Mandy's face. All these years it has killed him to think Mandy had forgotten him and moved as far away as possible from him. But now they're back in Texas, and he's going to do all he can to win back her love.
HIS HEART FOR THE TRUSTING
Ever since Mitch Broader set foot in Texas, he dreamed of owning his own ranch. Now that he's bought a share in the Double T Ranch, he's one step closer to the dream. Then his past greets him in the form of a baby basket, complete with infant and birth certificate naming him as the father. He can't change diapers and work toward his dream at the same time.
When Sara Lightfoot, ""Miss Hollywood"" in Mitch's eyes, rescues him with her particular knack for handling his precocious son, he hires her on the spot as a temporary nanny. No matter how much Sara's dark eyes and warm heart make this bachelor think of making their arrangement permanent, she's made it perfectly clear she has other plans that don't include him or his dreams.
Sara Lightfoot never thought she'd return to her home on the reservation. Now she plans to reclaim the life she left by going back to the reservation as a Native American storyteller, teaching the Apache children stories of their culture. She didn't expect Mitch Broader's sexy smile or job offer as a live-in nanny to derail those plans. After all she's been through to come home, can she open up her heart once again to love?
THE MORE I SEE
As a top-notch cutting horse trainer, Cody Gentry was riding high until he lost his eyesight after a freak chemical accident. Unable to see the hand in front of his face, never mind the horse or cattle he trained, he knows his life is over and slips deep into depression. His whole future hinges on the success of an eye surgery that could give him his old life back.
When guide dog trainer, Lyssa McElhannon, arrives on his ranch like Florence Nightingale coming to save him, he wants no part of her or her guide dog. But something about Lyssa's musical laugh coupled with her tenacity digs under his skin and won't let go. Having been blind most of her life, Lyssa understands the paralyzing fear Cody feels after losing his vision. But she refuses to let the stubborn cowboy waste his life away sitting in a chair when she knows first-hand that a good guide dog can change his world. She just needs one month to prove it to him.
Falling in love with Cody was not part of Lyssa's plan, nor was having him open her eyes to see that there was a whole lot of living she'd been missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There was material always, walking or running, fighting or screaming or singing."" From the life of Chicago's South Side she made a forceful and passionate poetry that fused Modernist aesthetics with African-American cultural tradition, a poetry that registered the life of the streets and the upheavals of the 20th century. Starting with A Street in Bronzeville(1945), her epoch-making debut volume, The Essential Gwendolyn Brookstraces the full arc of her career in all its ambitious scope and unexpected stylistic shifts.
""Her formal range,"" writes editor Elizabeth Alexander, ""is most impressive, as she experiments with sonnets, ballads, spirituals, blues, full and off-rhymes. She is nothing short of a technical virtuoso."" That technical virtuosity was matched by a restless curiosity about the life around her in all its explosive variety. By turns compassionate, angry, satiric, and psychologically penetrating, Gwendolyn Brooks's poetry retains its power to move and surprise.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But when one of them stumbles across an enormous treasure that wasn't on the manifest, everything goes sideways. Within minutes two of them are dead, leaving the third, a coldblooded psychopath, to claim both the sapphires and the mysterious windfall for himself. If he disappears, he won't just be wealthy. He'll have the power to change the course of history.

Within hours he's flying halfway around the world to find her in the glimmering neon slums of Macau. Jack has no real name, no address and no fingerprints--but given the right motivation, he can make serious problems vanish. Though the two haven't talked since they botched a job six years ago, as soon as Jack's off the plane they're back together again, facing down a crime boss, a hit man and a conspiracy bigger than anything they've ever encountered and more dangerous than they could've imagined.

He attracted a cult-like following that lined up to buy the computers and gadgets produced by Apple Inc. Over the years, people discovered the e-mail address of Jobs and took to regularly sending him messages. That he often responded was as unusual as his leadership style and his processes for crafting hit products.
Mark Milian, a technology writer for CNN, has reviewed more than a hundred of these e-mails, compiled from those posted by fans to blogs and online message boards. Some never-before-published e-mails from Jobs were shared exclusively for this book. As a whole, these correspondences provide a behind-the-scenes and inside-the-mind account of Jobs' final and most triumphant years. During this time, he returned to Apple and led the beleaguered computer maker from the brink of bankruptcy to becoming the most valuable technology company in the world, while also managing Pixar Animation Studios, an innovative production company that rocketed the Walt Disney Company into a new era of family films.
This book is based on interviews with many of the customers and fans Jobs communicated with. These tales reveal the intricacies of how Jobs portrayed himself as likable and accessible through direct interaction with fans. He handled customer-service inquiries himself and carefully revealed hints about upcoming Apple products, guaranteeing headlines on blogs. However, some of these letters, when analyzed, provide a glimpse into his ""reality distortion field,"" in which he lobs insults, bends the truth and uses misdirection in order to manipulate anyone on the receiving end.

Winner of the Guardian First Book award, a first-hand account one of the defining outrages of modern history.
All at once, as it seemed, something we could have only imagined was upon us - and we could still only imagine it. This is what fascinates me most in existence: the peculiar necessity of imagining what is, in fact, real.
In 1994, the Rwandan government orchestrated a campaign of extermination, in which everyone in the Hutu majority was called upon to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Close to a million people were slaughtered in a hundred days, and the rest of the world did nothing to stop it. A year later, Philip Gourevitch went to Rwanda to investigate the most unambiguous genocide since Hitler's war against the Jews.

The book reveals how Americans on both sides of the Mason and Dixon line withstood four years of brutal, unrelenting conflict. Of the hundreds of thousands of books published on the American Civil War, this is one of the few to approach the nation's defining conflict from this powerful perspective.
Grounded in rare family letters and diaries, Don't Hurry Me Down to Hades captures Americans' wide-ranging reactions to the war and their astonishing perseverance. Some of the accounts are entirely unknown to readers, while better-known events are told from unusual perspectives. Abraham Lincoln's assassination, for example, is shared from the viewpoint of Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancee (and stepsister) Clara Harris, while Lewis Powell's attempt on Secretary of State William Seward's life is seen through the terrified eyes Fanny Seward, who was seated next to her father when Powell burst into the room. Madison and Lizzie Bowler help readers understand how the war brought a Minnesota couple together in marriage and then nearly drove them apart when Madison insisted that his first duty was to his nation while Lizzie believed it was to her and their newborn daughter. A thousand miles to the south, two Texas families also suffered through their soldiers' absence and tried to explain to their young children why father had ""gone to war"" with ""Santaclause."" And to the north in Kentucky, a runaway slave won freedom for himself and his family by joining the Union Army only to face prejudice as brutal and destructive as the life he'd left behind.
Readers are carried alongside these families, sharing their dreams that the fighting might end this year and suffering with them when the Reaper comes calling. Through these and other stories, Don't Hurry Me Down to Hades invites readers to set aside previous assumptions to learn about the divisions and range of opinions on both sides from ordinary and famous men and women, black and white, slave and free. Esteemed Civil War historian Susannah J. Ural brings fresh insight into the war by delving into historical archives and private family papers to peal back the passage of time. Her consummate narrative weaves together a textured, powerful portrait of a nation at war with itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,

- Naomi Shihab Nye
How do we read a poem? What can we teach from a poem we love? How can we name what poets do in order to inform our writing, our teaching?
In their staff development work with teachers, Nick Flynn and Shirley McPhillips have often encountered these and similar questions. This book invites preservice and inservice teachers, staff developers - anyone who wants to make a lasting place for poetry in their own and their students' lives - into many of these same primary through middle school classrooms for an up-close look at several thoughtful, rigorous, poetry inquiries.
Each chapter begins with a mentor poem as the centerpiece for discussion, followed by a short narrative of ways the authors view their world through that chapter's particular poetic ""lens."" The authors then walk the reader into a classroom writer's workshop where, through vignettes, conversations, and carefully designed mini-lessons, that chapter's key element of poetic practice is being studied over time.
Other aspects that will help teachers in designing and conducting inquiry around mentor poems include:
mini-lessons that take students through an inquiry from launch to in-depth extensions;
illustrations of student writing samples in the ""try it"" stages, successive drafts, and crafted poems;
words, stories, and examples of best-loved poets that inspire and instruct us in our own thinking and teaching;
appendixes that include various types of book lists, charts, conference transcripts, and additional poems.
A Note Slipped Under the Doorwill show how you might help your student writers let the poems they love teach them what they need to know, and build a writing life that includes finding and crafting their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Written by Joseph M. Siracusa, an internationally recognized expert, this lively volume introduces the subject of diplomacy from a historical perspective, providing examples from significant historical phases and episodes to illustrate the art of diplomacy in action, highlighting the milestones in its evolution. The book shows that, like war, diplomacy has been around a very long time, at least since the Bronze Age. It was primitive by today's standards, there were few rules, but it was a recognizable form of diplomacy. Since then, diplomacy has evolved greatly, to the extent that the major events of modern international diplomacy have dramatically shaped the world in which we live. Indeed, the case studies chosen here demonstrate that diplomacy was and remains a key element of statecraft, and that without skilful diplomacy political success may remain elusive.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As soon as men began writing they made Helen of Troy their subject. For close to 3000 years she's been both the embodiment of absolute female beauty & a reminder of the terrible power beauty can wield. Because of her double marriage to the Greek king Menelaus & the Trojan prince Paris, Helen was held responsible for enmity between East & West. For millennia she's been viewed as an agent of extermination. But who was she? Helen exists in many guises: a matriarch from the Heroic Age who ruled over one of the most fertile areas of the Mycenaean world; Helen of Sparta, the focus of a cult that conflated the heroine with a pre-Greek fertility goddess; the home-wrecker of the Iliad; the bitch-whore of Greek tragedy; the pin-up of Romantic artists. Focusing on the ""real"" Helen--a flesh-&-blood aristocrat from the Greek Bronze Age--Hughes reconstructs the life context of this prehistoric princess. Thru the eyes of a young Mycenaean woman, she examines the physical, historical & cultural traces that Helen has left on locations in Greece, N. Africa & Asia Minor. This book unpacks the facts & myths surrounding one of the most enigmatic & notorious figures of all time.

I remembered nothing about how I got there, or who my parents were. I couldn't even remember my name. I was tagged, labeled and doomed to cycle through state care for the next twelve years; moving from one family to another. They all rejected me as the dreams began to come, the memories began to return, and things around me began to explode.
Now my mind is full of a world of shadows, things that my heart pleads with me to be true, that I hope are only fantasy. That the disturbing past I see is not mine.
When I sleep I hear whispers of magic, and of evil queens, and a world that exists alongside our own. Things that could never be. But, there is one thing I know to be true. That there was a boy who was torn from me. A boy that I know means more to me than a brother, or than a lover. But what he is to me, I am not sure. I hear him cry for me in my dreams, I hear people call him The Catalyst.
I know I need to find him.

""The Little Girl Praying on the Hill"" is a bittersweet story based on the emotional childhood memories of a young girl trying to understand God's will. Growing up in a poor village of the post-World War II era in a country where half the men drink themselves to death by the age of forty, the confused child questions God. The beauty of nature around her animates her and paints the perfect combination of colors, but life in her rundown village, sinking in mud after each rainfall, is a strong contrast.
She exists between two worlds: her beautiful imagination and the harsh realities of life. The picture of majestic nature does not fit with the picture that God created for the people he loves. Why did he divide this world so unevenly? Why did he place her on the wrong side of the world? Her emotions rise to unreachable heights and sink to devastating lows. The heights are the happy moments of her life, filled with imaginary friends and sparkles of happiness, but the depths contain haunting memories, full of sadness and hate, crushed dreams and disappointments.
Her daily existence forces the little girl to find escape in an imaginary world where she feels free and happy. Hiding in her imaginary kingdom, the girl clings to nature, which helps her to cope with the misery in which she was born. The gripping beauty of his creation mesmerizes her young mind, but only for a moment before her memories of specific events make her doubt God's intentions. Standing on top of the hill, surrounded by magnificent nature, the little girl tries to recognize his wisdom. She's determined to understand the purpose for her existence.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Spanning 2,000 miles and traversing six states from Missouri to the Pacific Ocean, the Oregon Trail is the route that made America. In the fifteen years before the Civil War, when 400,000 pioneers used it to emigrate West--historians still regard this as the largest land migration of all time--the trail united the coasts, doubled the size of the country, and laid the groundwork for the railroads. The trail years also solidified the American character: our plucky determination in the face of adversity, our impetuous cycle of financial bubbles and busts, the fractious clash of ethnic populations competing for the same jobs and space. Today, amazingly, the trail is all but forgotten.
Rinker Buck is no stranger to grand adventures. ""The New Yorker ""described his first travel narrative, ""Flight of Passage,"" as ""a funny, cocky gem of a book,"" and with ""The Oregon Trail ""he seeks to bring the most important road in American history back to life. At once a majestic American journey, a significant work of history, and a personal saga reminiscent of bestsellers by Bill Bryson and Cheryl Strayed, the book tells the story of Buck's 2,000-mile expedition across the plains with tremendous humor and heart. He was accompanied by three cantankerous mules, his boisterous brother, Nick, and an ""incurably filthy"" Jack Russell terrier named Olive Oyl. Along the way, Buck dodges thunderstorms in Nebraska, chases his runaway mules across miles of Wyoming plains, scouts more than five hundred miles of nearly vanished trail on foot, crosses the Rockies, makes desperate fifty-mile forced marches for water, and repairs so many broken wheels and axels that he nearly reinvents the art of wagon travel itself. Apart from charting his own geographical and emotional adventure, Buck introduces readers to the evangelists, shysters, natives, trailblazers, and everyday dreamers who were among the first of the pioneers to make the journey west. With a rare narrative power, a refreshing candor about his own weakness and mistakes, and an extremely attractive obsession for history and travel, ""The Oregon Trail"" draws readers into the journey of a lifetime.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Three young friends meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse. They are Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and their friend Raymond Aron, who opens their eyes to a radical new way of thinking. Pointing to his drink, he says, 'You can make philosophy out of this cocktail!'
From this moment of inspiration, Sartre will create his own extraordinary philosophy of real, experienced life-of love and desire, of freedom and being, of cafes and waiters, of friendships and revolutionary fervour. It is a philosophy that will enthral Paris and sweep through the world, leaving its mark on post-war liberation movements, from the student uprisings of 1968 to civil rights pioneers.
At the Existentialist Cafetells the story of modern existentialism as one of passionate encounters between people, minds and ideas. From the 'king and queen of existentialism'-Sartre and de Beauvoir-to their wider circle of friends and adversaries including Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Iris Murdoch, this book is an enjoyable and original journey through a captivating intellectual movement. Weaving biography and thought, Sarah Bakewell takes us to the heart of a philosophy about life that also changedlives, and that tackled the biggest questions of all: what we areand how we are to live.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Leader's Guide contains everything you need to lead this flexible course.
Christians are people who have discovered that the one true object of our worship is the God who has revealed himself in and through Jesus Christ. For most believers, worship is what happens for an hour on Sunday morning as we sing and pray together. But the Bible reveals a much bigger vision for what worship really is and how it should shape our lives.
So what exactly is worship? What should we be doing when we meet together for ""church"" on Sundays? And how does that connect with what we do the rest of the week? As we search the scriptures together we will discover that true worship is more than this--it is to encompass the whole of life. This engaging and flexible resource will challenge us to worship God every day of the week, with all our heart, mind, soul and strength.
This flexible resource will train your whole church through teaching, preaching, daily reading and small-group Bible study and discussion--or any combination of those elements. The overall aim is that your church will embark on a journey to discover the kind of people they should be as they are shaped by the gospel of Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You will discover a hitherto unimagined interest and value in all your actions, thoughts and memories, since you think to share them with another. Only gradually will you discover that it is impossible to do this wholly; that speech often obscures and sometimes conceals our thoughts; that the fictitious contacts of the flesh give an ecstasy which is poignant chiefly in that it reminds us of the incommunicable solitude of our souls."" A powerful Enchanter, Aldebaran, discoverer of the precious Elixir of Eternal Youth, is tired of playing with the lives of men and retires to his beautiful kingdom located on the path between the earth and the moon. There, he passes his time educating his beautiful daughter, Melusine, in the intricate profession of sorcery; his only worry is that she should never experience the misery of the mortal world.

A late expression of Chin-tan (""Golden Elixir"") Taoism, it teaches manipulation of internal forces (""light"") to achieve revitalization and spiritual rebirth. The work became famous in the West when Richard Wilhelm translated it in 1929, and published it with a commentary by psychologist Carl Jung. In an afterword, Cleary confesses the importance that the Wilhelm/Jung version had for his own personal development. Yet he misses few opportunities to disparage both Wilhelm and Jung, charging that their version ""contains dangerous and misleading contaminations"" (p. 5). It is, at best, ironic that Cleary, never obsessed by historical or textual niceties, accuses Wilhelm of publishing ""a garbled translation of a truncated version of a corrupted rescension"" (p. 3). Cleary's familiarity with Chin-tan texts does exceed Wilhelm's, but on the whole his translation is not much better. Extensive notes do illumine some passages, largely through use of a commentary by the 19th-century Taoist Liu I-ming. But as usual, Cleary's renderings are often unblushing paraphrases, and specific readings are sometimes simply arbitrary assignations of meaning based on his own ""transcultural, transdogmatic appreciation of the mental dynamic of religion"" (p. 133). Both the scholar and the general reader should approach this, like most of his earlier offerings, with due circumspection.

Sixtyis a report from the front, a dispatch from the Maginot Line that divides the middle-aged from the soon to be elderly. As Ian writes, ""It is the age when the body begins to dominate the mind, or vice versa, when time begins to disappear and loom, but never in a good way, when you have no choice but to admit that people have stopped looking your way, and that in fact they stopped twenty years ago.""
Ian began keeping a diary with a Facebook post on the morning of February 4, 2014, his sixtieth birthday. As well as keeping a running tally on how he survived the year, Ian explored what being sixty means physically, psychologically and intellectually. ""What pleasures are gone forever? Which ones, if any, are left? What did Beethoven, or Schubert, or Jagger, or Henry Moore, or Lucien Freud do after they turned sixty?"" And most importantly, ""How much life can you live in the fourth quarter, not knowing when the game might end?""
With formidable candour, he tries to answer this question: ""Does aging and elderliness deserve to be dreaded--and how much of that dread can be held at bay by a reasonable human being?""

When Maupassant wrote Bel-Amiin 1885 he was in the prime of life and at the height of his literary powers; he also knew that he was under sentence of death from syphilis. The result was at once a celebration of life and a devastating attack upon it; a tableau of splendour and squalor, strength and weakness, success and failure.
In this penetrating analysis of power and the lust for it we witness the endeavours of a young provincial to make good in the capital: the frenetic, corrupt Paris of the Third Republic. His single-mindedness, his exploitation of sex, his ruthless cunning and sheer good luck are presented with a wit and sensitivity which makes Bel-Amia dazzling tour-de-force.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thomas says of her fellow sociopaths, we are your neighbors, co-workers, and quite possibly the people closest to you: lovers, family, friends. Our risk-seeking behavior and general fearlessness are thrilling, our glibness and charm alluring. Our often quick wit and outside-the-box thinking make us appear intelligent--even brilliant. We climb the corporate ladder faster than the rest, and appear to have limitless self-confidence. Who are we? We are highly successful, non-criminal sociopaths and we comprise 4% of the American population (that's 1 in 25 people!).
Confessions of a Sociopathtakes readers on a journey into the mind of a sociopath, revealing what makes the tick and what that means for the rest of humanity. Written from the point of view of a diagnosed sociopath, it unveils these men and women who are ""hiding in plain sight"" for the very first time.
Confessions of a Sociopathis part confessional memoir, part primer for the wary. Drawn from Thomas' own experiences; her popular blog, Sociopathworld.com; and current and historical scientific literature, it reveals just how different - and yet often very similar - sociopaths are from the rest of the world. The book confirms suspicions and debunks myths about sociopathy and is both the memoir of a high-functioning, law-abiding (well, mostly) sociopath and a roadmap - right from the source - for dealing with the sociopath in your life, be it a boss, sibling, parent, spouse, child, neighbor, colleague or friend.
As Thomas argues, while sociopaths aren't like everyone else, and it's true some of them are incredibly dangerous, they are not inherently evil. In fact, they're potentially more productive and useful to society than neurotypicals or ""empaths,"" as they fondly like to call ""normal"" people. Confessions of a Sociopathdemystifyies sociopathic behavior and provide readers with greater insight on how to respond or react to protect themselves, live among sociopaths without becoming victims, and even beat sociopaths at their own game, through a bit of empathetic cunning and manipulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

R.H. Lockhart's account of the years he spent representing Britain's Foreign Office in Russia is still immensely entertaining and informative today. Lockhart was not an espionage agent; he was a diplomat. He was Britain's Vice-Consul in Moscow, then Acting Consul-General, then official ""unofficial"" representative to the new Bolshevik regime in Russia, between the years 1912 and 1918.
Lockhart describes his attempts at rubber farming as a young man in Malaysia and the circumstances that led to his seeking a career in the Foreign Office. He was given the post of British Vice-Consul in Moscow shortly after joining the Service.
In these memoirs, Lockhart gives us his insights into Russian culture and politics during the last years of Tzarist rule, the circumstances of Russia's participation in World War I, and Russia's descent into Bolshevism. Lockhart came to love the Russian people and consider Moscow his home while he witnessed the last Tzar unwittingly ensure his own downfall and the succeeding Provisional Government inevitably fail.
He gives an honest account of the errors in British and Allied policies during these precarious years in Russia. We get a close-up view of the eternal rift between diplomatic knowledge and political imperative.
""Memoirs of a British Agent"" is a supremely literate and insightful first-hand account of the fascinating and turbulent time in Russia that gave birth to the Soviet Union through the eyes of a foreigner who knew many prominent members of both the Tzarist and Bolshevik regimes personally. Lockhart manages to convey great sympathy for Russians of various ideologies while at the same time speaking bluntly of their shortcomings. Rarely has a book that is so informative been so entertaining. ""Memoirs of a British Agent"" is a real page-turner.",,,,,,,,,,,,

9895813,Rain,,,,eng,,,,,,4.25,1,1,,"I don't routinely review young adult fiction. I consider Rain a special case and I judged the book using my normal benchmarks.
Rain has many of the problems of a debut novel in any genre. It is too long, too wordy, there are too many characters, especially considering the core of the plot, and there are some minor lapses in the internal logic. Having said that, I must also say that the novel is almost unputdownable. The author's insight into her generation's motivations and attitudes is right on.
Nicols takes readers inside the minds and psyches of young adults in a way that is interesting, compelling in many pages, and fitting to the story. Sure, a lot of the young people here stand up to fearsome forces in ways most would not, but this is fiction, a fantasy and writers are allowed some leeway.
The writer's style takes a little getting used to and the pace, especially early on may be too portentous for some, but I urge readers to have a little patience, because once the story gets going, it really does get going.

9963269,Agatha Christie's Murder in the Making: Stories and Secrets from her Archive,,2011,0007396767,eng,,,,,,4.17,11,3,,"In this follow-up volume to the award-winning 'Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks', Christie archivist and expert John Curran leads the reader through the six decades of Agatha's writing career, unearthing some remarkable clues to her success and a number of never-before-published excerpts and stories from her archives.
Starting his investigation in the 1920s, John Curran examines the conventions of detective fiction as it existed then and reveals how Agatha Christie's publisher talked her into changing the ending of her very first book, 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles', a move that almost certainly changed the fortunes of not only her career but also the future of the detective novel. For the very first time, this book prints Agatha's original ending, painstakingly transcribed from the hand-written draft in one of her earliest notebooks.
Every decade saw Agatha Christie's success grow to new heights. The emergence of the world-famous Collins Crime Club in 1930 brought with it the very first Miss Marple novel; the austerity of the 1940s had Agatha Christie preparing to kill off Hercule Poirot; and the 1950s saw her experiment increasingly with stories influenced by more modern thrillers. Focusing on more than 20 Christie novels as detailed evidence, John Curran demonstrates the evolution of Agatha's writing through the decades, including her perseverance through the Swinging Sixties and Seventies into old age, concluding with a look at Agatha's last notebook and her ideas for an unwritten final book.
As well as revealing more than a dozen unpublished book ideas, 'Agatha Christie's Murder in the Making' contains two new short stories from her archives - 'The Man Who Knew' and an early Miss Marple draft, 'The Case of the Caretaker's Wife'.
NB: The first edition, first printing, has the ISBN on the reverse of the title page as in this record of the book but the back of the dust wrapper carries a different ISBN - 9780007908561!

February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. ""My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,"" the president says at the time. ""God has called him home."" Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy's body.
From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state--called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo--a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul.
Lincoln in the Bardois an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?

During her life, Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII s ill-fated second queen, was internationally famous or notorious; today, she still attracts passionate adherents and furious detractors. It was in London that most of the drama of Anne Boleyn s life and death was played out most famously, in the Tower of London, the scene of her coronation celebrations, of her trial and execution, and where her body lies buried. Londoners, like everyone else, clearly had strong feelings about her, and in her few years as a public figure Anne Boleyn was influential as a patron of the arts and of French taste, as the center of a religious and intellectual circle, and for her purchasing power, both directly and as a leader of fashion. It was primarily to London, beyond the immediate circle of the court, that her carefully 'spun' image as queen was directed during the public celebrations surrounding her coronation. In the centuries since Anne Boleyn s death, her reputation has expanded to give her an almost mythical status in London, inspiring everything from pub names to music hall songs, and novels to merchandise including pin cushions with removable heads. And now there is a thriving online community surrounding her there are over fifty Twitter accounts using some version of her name.This book looks at the evidence both for the effect London and its people had on the course of Anne Boleyn s life and death, and the effects she had, and continues to have, on them.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasingly, we have to be out there in the world, sharing our knowledge and being visible in order to have a successful career.
Public speaking can be an extra income stream, or can form an integral part of your marketing. It's also a good idea to plan for success and authors/creatives often have to speak when they become well-known, so it's best to start practicing earlier.
This book is a starter pack and an easy reference guide with the information that you need the most to speak confidently and professionally in public. And, although some chapters have specific tips for introverts, much of this information will be useful for anyone who is interested in public speaking, regardless of their personality type.
In this book, I'll share everything that I know as a professional speaker and introverted author-entrepreneur. It contains lots of tips about public speaking in general, based on my own experience over the last five years. In addition, I cover some specific points that creative introverts need to consider as speakers. You can read this book from start to finish, but you can also dip in and out, as each chapter contains succinct tips that you'll need at different times on your journey.
Part 1 goes into the practicalities of speaking: types of speaking, preparation, your actual talk, and what happens afterwards.
Part 2 is about some of the psychological aspects of speaking: your mindset, authenticity, confidence, and tackling the inevitable anxiety, which we all feel.
Part 3 discusses the business side of speaking: financials, marketing, and how to create multiple streams of income.
Part 4 contains interviews with three fantastic professional speakers, each from a different market, to give you a variation in perspective. Mark McGuinness is an introvert, Clare Edwards is an extrovert and Alastair Humphreys sits somewhere in the middle. There are also videos, audio and extra image-formatted transcripts, so you can experience this information in other modes if you prefer.
The Appendices contain resources that may be useful in your speaking journey, including my own speaking checklist and booking form, example sales page and a series of questions for you to answer that will kickstart your public speaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Genji is the favorite son of the emperor but also a man of dangerously passionate impulses. In his highly refined world, where every dalliance is an act of political consequence, his shifting alliances and secret love affairs create great turmoil and very nearly destroy him.
Edward Seidensticker's translation of Lady Murasaki's splendid romance has been honored throughout the English-speaking world for its fluency, scholarly depth, and deep literary tact and sensitivity.

Here are dramatic views of such iconic events as the plague, the Great Fire of London, and the Blitz, but also William Thackeray's account of going to see a man hanged, Thomas De Quincey's friendship with a teenaged prostitute, and Doris Lessing's defense of the Underground.

Arnold Toynbee writes:
In the first volume of A Study of History,I start by searching for a unit of historical study that is relatively self-contained and is therefore more or less intelligible in isolation from the rest of history. I was led into this quest by finding myself dissatisfied with the present-day habit of studying history in terms of national states. These seemed, and still seem, to me to be fragments of something larger, and I found this larger and more satisfying unit of study in a civilization. The history of the United States, for instance, or the history of Britain, is, as I see it, a fragment of the history of Western Christendom or the Western Christian World, and I believe I can put my finger on a number of other societies, living or extinct, that are of the same species. Examples of other living civilizations besides the Western Civilization are the Islamic and the Civilization of Eastern Asia, centring on China. Examples of extinct civilizations are the Greco-Roman and the Ancient Egyptian. This practice of dealing in civilizations instead of nations is taken for granted by orientalists, ancient-historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists. The carving-up of a civilization into pieces labelled ""nations"" is, I believe, something peculiar to students of modern Western history, and, with them too, this present practice of theirs is only recent. Down to the beginning of the eighteenth century the classic works of Western historians took for their field the whole history of Western Christendom or even the whole history of the World from the creation to the Last Judgement.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Twice widowed with three children by age 21, Lola braved a British blockade and German U-boats off the coast of South America in her quest for security and happiness. Lola lived a life of drama and hardship from the Andes to San Francisco, but she never gave up and she never stopped loving.
Fear of impending death often impels people to divulge secrets they have guarded for many years. Thus it was that Lola, sick and frightened, confided the story of her youth to her daughter, the author's mother, who at age 95, passed the story on as the author sat by her hospital bed for two days. The story had many gaps, all of which were filled with fiction.

What he has to say will inspire mind-shifts and alter our perception of the universe. Bailey's revolutionary theory emerged from a whimsically phrased, but ultimately serious question that scientists tried to answer: ""if an elephant were sucked into a black hole, where would its matter go?"" They ultimately realized that each person's vision of the elephant's fate shifted depending on his or her particular viewing position. And that's what Bailey allows us to do: see reality from a different perspective. By linking the apparently unrelated fields of quantum physics, holistic health, cosmology, theology, neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and consciousness studies, Bailey proves that each is a facet of a greater, unified reality, and that science and spirituality are two sides of the same coin. With this knowledge, we will finally understand our place in the universe and gain new insights into some of the most challenging questions facing the world today.",,,,,,,,,,,,

True, the word strangersin his title refers to foreigners. However, it also refers to American foreign policymakers & diplomats, whose failure to ""speak each other's language"" deprives foreign policy of realism & coherence. In a world where regions have become more important than blocs, ethnic & transnational problems more important than superpower rivalries, foreign policy must be better informed if it's to be more effective. The insights required won't come from summit meetings or tv specials but from the 1sthand observations of trained Foreign Service officers. He's not written an apologia for the Foreign Service, however. His criticism of many of its weaknesses is biting. Ranging from a description of Benjamin Franklin's mission to France to an analysis of the Gulf War & its aftermath, he offers a balanced critique of how American diplomacy developed in reaction to European models & how it needs to be changed to satisfy the demands of the 21st century. Full of examples drawn from experience, Talking to Strangersaddresses the problems that arise not only from an overly politicized foreign policy process but also from excessive bureaucratization & lack of leadership in the Foreign Service itself. Anyone interested in our nation's future will benefit from reading his pull-no-punches analysis of why improving diplomacy should be a matter of urgent concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From the war-ravaged streets of Sarajevo, where turning up for training involved dodging snipers' bullets, to the crumbling splendor of Budapest's Bozsik Stadium, where the likes of Puskas and Kocsis masterminded the fall of England, the landscape of Eastern Europe has changed immeasurably since the fall of communism. Jonathan Wilson has traveled extensively behind the old Iron Curtain, viewing life beyond the fall of the Berlin Wall through the lens of soccer. Where once the state-controlled teams of the Eastern bloc passed their way with crisp efficiency--a sort of communist version of total soccer--to considerable success on the European and international stages, today the beautiful game in the East has been opened up to the free market, and throughout the region a sense of chaos pervades. The threat of totalitarian interference no longer remains; but in its place mafia control is generally accompanied with a crippling lack of funds. Jonathan Wilson goes in search of the spirit of Hungary's Golden Squad of the early 1950s; charts the disintegration of the soccer superpower that was the former Yugoslavia; follows a sorry tale of corruption, mismanagement, and Armenian cognac through the Caucasuses; reopens the case of Russia's greatest soccer player, Eduard Streltsov; and talks to Jan Tomaszewski about an autumn night at Wembley in 1973.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two women, who have every reason not to be attracted to one another, share a house and a dog and gradually find they have feelings they didn't expect--and don't want to own. Do they belong together, despite their differences, or should they move on to other people and other places? Artist Valerie Stephans has fled San Francisco following the death of her longtime partner Doreen Hawkins. She has embarked on a new life in Eureka, an historic community and artist's colony on California's scenic but remote North Coast. To make ends meet, Val decides to take in roomers, and as the novel begins, she opens the front door to a scrawny young woman with deep blue eyes who needs a place to live--and has more mental baggage than personal belongings. Locked in their landlord-tenant relationship, Val finds Gina Fortenham a mystery, and the reclusive tenant attempts to remain so. Why Val wonders, as do her lesbian friends, would a woman with a doctorate in English literature work as a waitress rather than teach college? And is she a lesbian? Eventually, Gina admits that she owes a sizable debt from a sexuality crisis and resulting psychotherapy in Tucson, Arizona, where she had been a graduate student. When the debt is paid, she plans on moving to San Francisco--which for an Illinois farm girl has always seemed the pinnacle of sophistication and where she hopes to teach and create her future. Sharing the same household brings Valerie and Gina into tentative intimacies which each fights to avoid. Val in her early 50s is a stable adult and would not involve herself in anything but a committed relationship. Gina, a 30-something and still sorting herself out, thinks that writing and teaching are her number one priority. Sensual experiences--long walks on the beach, a day of sailing on the ocean--bring a growing sexual attraction between them anyway. Yet they continually fight off this bond. And, since their ages and life goals are so disparate, their friends also encourage them to avoid one another. After pushing herself to work three different part-time jobs, Gina finally pays off her debt, says goodbye to Eureka, and sets course for San Francisco--after a bittersweet farewell with Valerie. Arriving in the Bay Area, Gina is at first apprehensive and then excited. Her dreams begin to come true; she finds a full-time job, she visits all the famous landmarks, she tours the Castro, and she pursues a teaching job. She even has a woman boss, a definite dyke, who makes sexual overtures to her, and she has a fling with a beautiful American-Asian student. But after the initial excitement wears off, Gina begins to find herself thinking and dreaming of Eureka and of Valerie. Now she confronts herself: What are her real priorities? Meanwhile in Eureka, Val accepts that Gina is truly gone from her world and moves on with her artistic career. She also allows herself to become closer to one of her lesbian friends, Lainie Olson, a real estate agent who finds Val attractive. Keeping up with her North Coast friends through e-mail, Gina comes to a major decision. Some weeks later, her battered Beetle heads up the 101 toward Eureka, with a more confident, well-groomed Gina going for what she now knows she truly wants. When Valerie opens the door this time, the stakes are totally different. Val must face her own demons from the past as a determined Gina comes on strong.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To Sergeant Zeke Hayes, the expression has always been a non-factor. There's never been a situation he can't blast, punch, negotiate or smart-ass his way out of, which makes him the perfect fit for his Special Forces battalion--and a natural-born Dominant who's made a lot of submissives happy from Mt. Rainier to Vancouver.
That all changes when Rayna Chestain enters his world.
A rock.
From the moment Z snatches Rayna from the lair of a South Asian slave trafficker, his inner grizzly roars to life with protective intensity. This is a huge damn problem, because Z isn't wired to be a one-woman man. Growing up an orphan on the streets of Seattle has taught him that beyond a few hours in a dungeon, trust means disappointment and love leads to agony. But here he is, in the remote wilderness escape he'd promised not to share with anyone, harboring Rayna from a fiend who now wants his pound of revenge flesh from her--in the form of her beating heart. Zeke will stop at nothing to keep Rayna safe, even asking his SFG brothers to join him in the fight to hold his fortress secure.
A hard place.
Sheltering Rayna? Z's never done anything more right in his life. But wanting her? Dreaming of her body beneath him, bound and surrendering to his domination? It's the most forbidden fruit he can crave...and the only thing he can't stop thinking about.
A new beginning?
This is a dead-end canyon that no rifle, bomb or sweet talk will let Zeke escape from. The only way out is to confront the reality of what Rayna has done to him...the mountain she's moved in his intractable heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the intervening years there have been extraordinary advances in our understanding of the space and time. The technology for observing the micro- and macro-cosmic world has developed in leaps and bounds. During the same period cosmology and the theoretical sciences have entered a new golden age. Professor Stephen Hawking has been at the heart of this new scientific renaissance.

When two men meet in the Virginia state penitentiary in a maximum security visitation room on May 5, 1968, they have only one thing in common: they both want their lives back.
On one side of a glass divider sits Kenneth Deatherage, who was sentenced to death for the brutal rape and murder of a young woman. The jury agreed with the prosecutor's closing argument: that all evidence points to Deatherage as the killer. But Deatherage says the evidence was fabricated. He claims that the judge and his own lawyer rigged the trial against him.
On the other side of the divider sits Nate Abbitt, who was a successful prosecutor until he tried to drink his way through a midlife crisis. When he finally sobered up, he had lost his career, his marriage of thirty years, and his self-respect. He turned to criminal defense because it was the only work he could get.
When the court appoints Nate to represent Deatherage on appeal, Nate doesn't believe there's a grand conspiracy to send Deatherage to the electric chair. But when his investigation uncovers hints of corruption in the county justice system, he finds himself accused of murder by the same forces that convicted his client. To save himself, Nate risks his life and the lives of others, and in the process, discovers that he and Deatherage have much more in common than he wants to admit.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The other type of pride comes from our ego which is rather arrogant, selfish and gives us an inflated opinion of ourselves; a sense of superiority. In reality it makes us feel insecure, jealous and has us need to prove ourselves and impress those around us. Our ego thinks we're far more important than we are and therefore it won't allow us to admit we're wrong or that we've made a mistake.

When newlywed Abdulla loses his wife and unborn child in a car accident, the world seems to crumble beneath his feet. Thrust back into living in the family compound, he goes through the motions--work, eat, sleep, repeat. Blaming himself for their deaths, he decides to never marry again but knows that culturally, this is not an option. Three years later, he's faced with an arranged marriage to his cousin Hind, whom he hasn't seen in years. Hard-pressed to find a way out, he consents to a yearlong engagement and tries to find a way to end it. What he doesn't count on, and is unaware of, is Hind's own reluctance to marry.
Longing for independence, she insists on being allowed to complete a master's degree in England, a condition Abdulla readily accepts. When she finds an unlikely friend in Indian-American Sangita, she starts down a path that will ultimately place her future in jeopardy.
The greatest success of Rajakumar's novel is the emotional journey the reader takes via her rich characters. One cannot help but feel the pressure of the culturally mandated marriage set before Hind and Abdulla. He's not a real Muslim man if he remains single, and she will never be allowed freedoms without the bondage of a potentially loveless marriage. It's an impossible situation dictated by a culture that they still deeply respect.
Rajakumar pulls back the veil on life in Qatar to reveal a glimpse of Muslim life rarely seen by Westerners.

But we all know different. Cats are cruel. Stop any shrew or bankvole on the street and they'll describe them as mean, lean killing machines.
Cats are jealous too. They despise the fact that a dog is a man's best friend, yet it's them who do all the useful work around the yard. Since when has fetching sticks in a timely fashion helped society? Cats clear up the vermin and what do they get for it? ""Yuk, clear that off the doorstep!""
So, cats everywhere have taken a secret resolve to dispose of dogs in every which way they can, whether by simple means or, as we find out in 'When Cats Assassinate', by using tricks, strategies and high velocity weapons.
Cats are helped in their killer quest by most dogs' basic lack of brain cells. Curiosity may have killed a cat one time, but sheer stupidity killed most dogs. If dogs can learn anything from this book it's ""Never stick your head through a catflap that reads FREE DOG FOOD HERE.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Blaze of Glory takes us to the action-packed Western Theater for a vivid re-creation of one of the war's bloodiest and most iconic engagements--the Battle of Shiloh.
It's the spring of 1862. The Confederate Army in the West teeters on the brink of collapse following the catastrophic loss of Fort Donelson. Commanding general Albert Sidney Johnston is forced to pull up stakes, abandon the critical city of Nashville, and rally his troops in defense of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. Hot on Johnston's trail are two of the Union's best generals: the relentless Ulysses Grant, fresh off his career-making victory at Fort Donelson, and Don Carlos Buell. If their combined forces can crush Johnston's army and capture the railroad, the war in the West likely will be over. There's just one problem: Johnston knows of the Union plans, and is poised to launch an audacious surprise attack on Grant's encampment--a small settlement in southwestern Tennessee anchored by a humble church named Shiloh.
With stunning you-are-there immediacy, Shaara takes us inside the maelstrom of Shiloh as no novelist has before. Drawing on meticulous research, he dramatizes the key actions and decisions of the commanders on both sides: Johnston, Grant, Sherman, Beauregard, and the illustrious Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest. Here too are the thoughts and voices of the junior officers, conscripts, and enlisted men who gave their all for the cause, among them Confederate cavalry lieutenant James Seeley and Private Fritz ""Dutchie"" Bauer of the 16th Wisconsin Regiment--brave participants in a pitched back-and-forth battle whose casualty count would far surpass anything the American public had yet seen in this war. By the end of the first day of fighting, as Grant's bedraggled forces regroup for could be their last stand, two major events--both totally unexpected--will turn the tide of the battle and perhaps the war itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That rumor, of course, was true.
New Orleans was her home, at the Beauregard Boneyard, the safe haven the Club resided within. Only those in the inner circle were as Reveca was--immortal. To be as such you had to choose the life, and the life had to choose you. For either to occur, death came first.
Those deaths came from wars the Sons fought with both the mortal and immortal worlds, as they bent the decrees of the modern lawmen and the paranormal world at large who had no hope of opposing the dark splendor of their vengeance.
Presently, the mysterious murder of a mortal coupled with the cold-blooded slaying of Reveca's close friend has led the lawmen to place their corrupt accusations upon the Sons.

For some, the ritual we call brunch is a beloved pastime; for others, a bedeviling waste of time. But what does its popularity say about shifting attitudes towards social status and leisure? In some ways, brunch and other forms of conspicuous consumption have blinded us to ever-more-precarious employment conditions. For award-winning writer and urbanist Shawn Micallef, brunch is a way to look more closely at the nature of work itself and a catalyst for solidarity among the so-called creative class.
Drawing on theories from Thorstein Veblen to Richard Florida, Micallef traces his own journey from the rust belt to a cosmopolitan city where the evolving middle class he joined was oblivious to its own instability and insularity.
The Trouble with Brunchis a provocative analysis of foodie obsession and status anxiety, but it's also a call to reset our class consciousness. The real trouble with brunch isn't so much bad service and outsized portions of bacon, it's that brunch could be so much more.
